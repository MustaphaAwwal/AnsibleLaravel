# AltschoolExam

This repository contains my Exam project, which focuses on deploying Laravel and its dependencies using Ansible from a control node to a slave node.

## Deployment Instructions

To deploy from a control node to a slave machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/MustaphaAwwal/AltschoolExam.git
   ```

2. Set the IP address of the slave node in the `hostname` file. Ensure that you have the necessary network connectivity and SSH access to the slave node.

3. Configure the MySQL variables in the `mysql/vars/main.yml` file according to your environment requirements.

4. Run the Ansible playbook to initiate the deployment:
   ```
   ansible-playbook assignment.yml
   ```

   This playbook will automate the deployment process and configure the necessary components on the slave node.
